  # Fix RLS Policies for Frontend Compatibility

  1. Security Updates
    - Fix RLS policies that are blocking legitimate frontend operations
    - Add proper policies for authenticated users
    - Ensure frontend access patterns are supported

  2. Policy Adjustments
    - Update overly restrictive policies
    - Add missing policies for tables with RLS enabled
    - Fix policy logic for user-specific data access
