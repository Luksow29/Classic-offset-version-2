-- SIMPLE RLS DISABLE TEST - No Foreign Key Dependencies
-- This version tests basic table access without foreign key constraints

-- Disable RLS on chat tables
alter table public.order_chat_threads disable row level security;
alter table public.order_chat_messages disable row level security;

-- Show RLS status
select 'RLS Status - Threads:' as label, 
       case when relrowsecurity then 'ENABLED' else 'DISABLED' end as status
from pg_class 
where relname = 'order_chat_threads'
union all
select 'RLS Status - Messages:' as label, 
       case when relrowsecurity then 'ENABLED' else 'DISABLED' end as status
from pg_class 
where relname = 'order_chat_messages';

select 'Current Thread Count:' as label, count(*)::text as value from public.order_chat_threads;
select 'Current Message Count:' as label, count(*)::text as value from public.order_chat_messages;

-- Test if we can describe the table structure
select 'Thread Columns:' as info, 
       string_agg(column_name || ':' || data_type, ', ' order by ordinal_position) as columns
from information_schema.columns 
where table_name = 'order_chat_threads' and table_schema = 'public';
